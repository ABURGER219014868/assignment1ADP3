READ ME:
In my elective of blockchain technology I see how cryptography plays a big role.
One of the simpler encryptions used as an example was the Ceasar cipher – where the alphabet
is offset by a certain number (that would be your key) for example if we have the
right offset or shift of 5 – A would be replaced by F . Your text you want to encrypt would be
something like “Always” to the cypher text of “Fqbfdx”. To demonstrate this, I wanted to build the code.
When researching this online, however, I found that someone else has already done that in Java.
This code imports that maven dependency and runs the main functions to show how the cipher would be
used but also how easily it could be solved.
